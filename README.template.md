 <h1 align="center">Hello Everyone!</h1>

  <p>
    I am Patrick Ducusin, or @PattyCoding123. I am a third-year student at Wayne State University, and I am currently 
    working towards my Bachelors of Science in Computer Science.
    <br />
    <br />
    I mostly work with C++, Java, Python, and Dart.
    <br />
    <br />
    Currently, I am trying to learn more front-end development with React.js
    <br />

    I have completed projects such as a fullstack note-taking app, personal portfolio, and
    an eCommerce webpage.
